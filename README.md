# smart_save

My first demo finTech App.

## Getting Started

This project is my very first flutter project and I would like to document my journey.

A few things I started out with:

### I have found a way to change the app launcher both on android and on the web version.
- That of android was done using the flutter_launcher_icons in pubspec.yaml.
- The web version was done directly from the index.html file.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
